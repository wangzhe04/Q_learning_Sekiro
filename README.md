# Q_learning_Sekiro
Used Q Learning to train an AI to play against bosses in Sekiro:
used screenshot of frames and the color of the hp bar to determine if AI got hit or not, similary used the same mechanism to check if the AI hit the boss or not. 
positive reward for hit the enemy, negative for losing hp(obvious)
